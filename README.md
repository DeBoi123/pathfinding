# pathfinding
first attempt on implementing an A* search algorithm

The first implementation will not actually be an A* algorithm, but rather a very crude pathfinding algorithm which doesnt
take any heuristics into account.
Starting at the player location all possible paths will be extended until one of them reaches the goal location.
